# IDEAS

##  Graphics

* Animations!


## World generation

* Make walls part of the world

* Infinite worlds
    - Always show player in the center of a square which moves underneath him
    as he walks.
    - By extension: Player can visually walk around within a certain range
    before the world starts moving instead.

* Round world
    - Expand logic to include whether a tile has a floor

* Worlds with height variation (integer) to create "parcours"

* Worlds with different floor materials, like sand and water (aesthetic / functional)


## Interaction

* allow placing more objects (colored marks, block types, ladders, ...)
    - parameter: hinlegen("ziegel"), hinlegen(3, "ziegel")

* interact with existing objects (e.g. chests)

* player inventory?
